Hello, I'm jaechang Kim. I'm a graduate student in [POSTECH Machine Learning Lab](http://ml.postech.ac.kr/) since 2021,
under supervision of Prof. [Jungseul Ok](https://sites.google.com/view/jungseulok).

My current research focuses primarily on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance explainable AI. I explore how the reasoning and linguistic capabilities of LLMs can help interpret complex models and facilitate knowledge extraction. Besides this core direction, my broader research interests include:

* Trustworthy Machine Learning: Developing methods to explain the rationale behind machine learning model decisions and effectively transfer this knowledge to humans.

* Diverse ML Applications: Investigating a variety of applications, such as automated theorem proving and sound source separation.
