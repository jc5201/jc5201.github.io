### This is a brief scan for ICASSP papers, searched with “source separation” (not all papers). 

Personal opinions:

- Still the most prevailing baselines seem to be ConvTasnet and demucs.
- Multi domain(?) problems are defined from mixtures of speech, music, and others
- Spatial information is started to be used

## Spatial/multi-channel

- **[Spain-Net: Spatially-Informed Stereophonic Music Source Separation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746277/)**
    - spatial data + instrument-specific features
    - separation of same-class instruments
    - spatial condition (angle) as input of separation system
- **[An End-to-End Deep Learning Framework For Multiple Audio Source Separation And Localization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746950/)**
    - Estimate sources and TDOA(time differences of arrival) jointly

- **[Locate This, Not that: Class-Conditioned Sound Event DOA Estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9747604/)**
    - DOA(direction of arrival) estimation

- **[A Multi-Task Learning Method for Weakly Supervised Sound Event Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746947/)**
    - multi-task learning := sound event detection and source separation
    - supervised for separation and weakly labeled for event detection (only event type)

## Unsupervised/weak-sup
